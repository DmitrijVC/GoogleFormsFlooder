# GoogleFormsFlooder
Just found that script deep down my drive. <br>
It's kinda bad, but I am not going to update it. <br>
I didn't even check if `from_json` works.

## Usage
- Put the .har file next to main.py
- Change `1FAIpQLSelHnYQUmpSnCb_KPiyTFKGu0qGLEV1CtMAlllknC34zv2fSA` to the specific form ID
- Change `docs.google.com_Archive [20-12-23 10-12-45].har` to your .har file
